Wild Engine
Tristan Fountain, 2016


To do:

-Implement screen rotation events on demand for events
-Implement reading initial controls from a config file

Note: To properly build this project, you must place it in a Visual Studio environment with the proper SFML linkers and libraries set up. I am using SFML 2.0, so all versions
	  succeeding version 2.0 should work properly.
